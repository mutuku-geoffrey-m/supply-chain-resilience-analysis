# Supply Chain Resilience & Cost Optimization Strategy

**Role:** Data Strategy Lead  
**Tools:** Excel, Tableau, Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI)  
**Status:** Completed (Feb 2026)

## 📌 Executive Summary
Analyzed 27,000+ shipping records to identify why Western European logistics costs remained at crisis levels post-COVID. Discovered a structural "Efficiency Gap" in Standard Class ground transport, projecting **$1.2M in annual savings** via AI-driven dynamic routing.

## 🔍 Key Findings
* **The "Resilience Gap":** While global supply chain pressure (GSCPI) dropped to -0.1 in 2025, internal costs in France stayed elevated at ~$35k/year.
* **Root Cause:** "Standard Class" shipments account for **41%** of total delay penalties.
* **Opportunity:** Dynamic routing can reduce late delivery probability by 30%.
